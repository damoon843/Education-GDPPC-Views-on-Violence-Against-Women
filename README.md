# A Study of the Relationship Among Education, GDP Per Capita, and Views on Violence Against Women

This project focuses on the effect of level of education and GDP per capita to explain views on violence against women. The data for this project comes from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/violence-against-women-and-girls?). To learn more about Operation Fistula and their work, visit [this](https://opfistula.org/) website.

There are two parts (and two jupyter notebooks) to this project: one for data preparation/validation and one for data exploration/visualizations/interesting findings. Both have been commented clearly so definitely check those out to learn more about the insights I found from the given data.
